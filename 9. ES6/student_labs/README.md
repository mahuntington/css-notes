1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price
